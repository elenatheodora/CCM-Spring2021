    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a topic in machine learning and psychology/neuroscience which considers how an emboddied agent should learn to make decisions in an environment in order to maximize reward.  You could definitely do worse things in life than to read the classic text on RL by Sutton and Barto:\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='images/rlsutton.png' width='300'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent at each time point chooses an action which influences the state of the world according to the rules of the environment (e.g., spatial layout of a building or the very nature of physics).  This results in a new state ($s_{t+1}$) and possibly a reward ($r_{t+1}$).  The agent then receives the new state and the reward signal and updates in order to choose the next action.  The goal of the agent is to maximize the reward received over the long run.  In effect this approach treats life like an optimal control problem (one where the goal is to determine the best actions to take for each possible state).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity and power of this framework has made it very influential in recent years in psychology and computer science.  Recently more advanced techniques for solving RL problems have been scaled to show impressive performance on complex, real-world tasks.  For example, so called \"deep RL\" system which combine elements of deep convolutional nets and reinforcement learning algorithms can learn to play classic video games at near-human performance, simply by aiming to earn points in the game:\n",

    "The problem we will consider is a grid world task.  The grid is a collection of rooms.  Within each room there are four possible actions (move up, down, left, right).  There are also walls in the maze that the agent cannot move through (indicated in blue-grey below).  There are two special states, $S$ which is the start state, and $G$ which is the goal state.  The agent will start at location $S$ and aims to arrive at $G$.  When the agents moves into the $G$ state they earn a reward of +10.  If they walk off the edge of the maze, they receive a -1 reward and are returned to the $S$ state.  $G$ is an absorbing state in the sense that you can think of the agent as never leaving that state once they arrive there.\n",

Your algorithm should do this by visiting each state in a random order and updating it's value in the `value_table` (this is known as asychronous update since you are changing the values in-place).  \n",

    "In the previous exercise you solved the sequential decision making problem using policy iteration.  However, you relied heavily on the information provided by the `GridWorld()` class, especially $\\mathcal{P}^{a}_{ss'}$ (`mygrid.transitions`) and $\\mathcal{R}^{a}_{ss'}$ (`rewards`).  These values are not commonly known when an agent faces an environment.  In this step of the homework you will solve the same grid world problem this time using Monte-Carlo.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "[Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) are ones where stochastic samples are drawn from a problem space and aggregated to estimate quantities of interest.  In this case we want to average the expected rewards available from a state going forward.  Thus, we will use Monte Carlo methods to estimate the value of particular actions or states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific Monte-Carlo algorithm you should use is known as First-Visit Monte Carlo (described in lecture).  According to this algorithm, each time you first visit a state (or state-action pair) you record the rewards received until the end of an episode.  You do this many times and then average together the rewards received to estimate the value of the state or action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, as you did in problem 1, you adjust your policy to become greedy with respect to the values you have estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two significant conceptual changes in applying Monte-Carlo to the gridworld problem.  First is that rather than estimate the value of each state $V^{\\pi}(s)$ under the current policy $\\pi$, it makes more sense to estimate the value of each state-action pair, $Q^{\\pi}(s,a)$, directly.  The reason is that in your previous solution, in order to determine the optimal policy, you likely had to know $\\mathcal{P}^{a}_{ss'}$ to determine which action to perform and which state it would lead to.  Since we are trying to avoid accessing any explicit knowledge about the probabilities and rewards we cannot use this variable in our solution.  Thus, average the returns following the first visit to a particular action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is what policy we should use for running our Monte Carlo updates.  If we randomly initialize the policy as we did above and then run it forward it is very easy for the runs to get caught in cycles and loops that never visit many of the states or ever encounters any rewards.  Thus, we will want to include some randomness in our simulations so that they have a non-zero probability of choosing different actions.  We will consider this issue in more detail in Part B of the homework.  For now use the $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm which chooses the currently \"best\" action with probability $1-\\epsilon$ and otherwise chooses randomly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will utilize the concept of **exploring starts**.  Even though we designated one state as the \"Start state\" it can help the monte carlo algorithm explore more efficiently if we start the episodes from random starting locations.  The reason is that early on the policy might have loops and other inconistencies which mean some states are rarely sampled, if at all.  Exploring starts (when feasible) can help the algorithm avoid these local minima."

They should work out to the same optimal policies, obtained using a quite different method, and one that in particular doesn't need an explicit model of the environment.\n",

    "Keep in mind that in cases where there are two equally good actions which one is selected and shown in your policy table is arbitrary.
